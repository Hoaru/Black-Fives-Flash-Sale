# Black-Friday-Flash-Sale

During the Black Friday, some on-line shopping website would like to attract customers by selling some products at lower prices.
For example, the normal price of an iPhone 14 is $799, and some websites would like to sell 10 iPhone 14 for only $499. At that
point, it would lead to a problem that a large amount of purchasing request which will bring the server great pressure. To solve
this problem, I develope a website to solve this problem. According to the test result from Apache JMeter, the throughput
increased from 560/h to 3600/h after optimization through AJAX, Redis RabbitMQ.

Front End: HTML + JavaScript/CSS + Lua

Back End: Java

Tools& Framework: SpringBoot, MyBatis-Plus, MySQL, Docker, Redis, RabbitMQ, AJAX, Apache JMeter
